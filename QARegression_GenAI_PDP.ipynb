      "When using SDS-PAGE for molecular weight determination, slight deviations from the calculated molecular weight of a protein (calculated from the known amino acid sequence) can occur due to the retention of varying degrees of secondary structure in the protein, even in the presence of SDS. This phenomenon is observed in highly organized secondary structures (collagens, histones, or highly hydrophobic membrane proteins) and in peptides, where the effect of local secondary structure becomes magnified relative to the total size of the peptide.\n",
      "Slight differences in protein mobilities also occur when the same proteins are run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems. Each SDS-PAGE buffer system has a different pH, which affects the charge of a protein and its binding capacity for SDS. The degree of change in protein mobility is usually small in natural proteins but more pronounced with 'atypical' or chemically modified proteins such as pre-stained standards.\n",

      "How to Use SimplyBlue\u000214 SafeStain\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "SimplyBlue\u000214 SafeStain is a ready-to-use proprietary Coomassie G-250 stain included in the NuPAGE Large Protein Staining Kit. It is formulated for fast, sensitive protein detection and safe, non-hazardous disposal. Proteins stained with SimplyBlue\u000214 SafeStain are compatible with mass spectrometry analysis.\n",
      "Basic Protocol\n",
      "Rinse the mini-gel 3 times for 5 minutes each with 100 mL deionized water to remove SDS and buffer salts. Discard each rinse.\n",
      "Stain the mini-gel with approximately 20 mL SimplyBlue\u000214 SafeStain to cover the gel. Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bands will develop within minutes. After staining, discard the stain; do not reuse.\n",
      "Wash the mini-gel with 100 mL water for 1-3 hours. The gel can remain in water for several days without loss of sensitivity.\n",
      "Notes:\n",
      "An alcohol/acetic acid fixing step prior to staining is not required or recommended.\n",
      "The gel can be stained up to 3 hours; beyond that, sensitivity decreases. For overnight staining, add 2 mL 20% NaCl per 20 mL stain to maintain sensitivity.\n",
      "For highest sensitivity, after 1 hour wash, add 20 mL 20% NaCl to fresh water and continue washing for 2 hours to overnight (detection limit: 7 ng BSA).\n",
      "For clearest background for photography, perform a second 1-hour wash with 100 mL water.\n",
      "After the second wash, sensitivity decreases if gel stays in water more than 1 day; add 20 mL 20% NaCl if storing for a few days.\n",
      "Microwave Protocol (Faster Method)\n",
      "Place gel in 100 mL deionized water in a loosely covered container and microwave on High (950-1100 watts) for 1 minute until solution almost boils.\n",
      "Shake gel on orbital shaker for 1 minute; discard water.\n",
      "Repeat steps 1 and 2 two more times.\n",
      "Add 20 mL SimplyBlue\u000214 SafeStain and microwave on High for 45 seconds to 1 minute until solution almost boils.\n",
      "Shake gel on orbital shaker for 5 minutes (detection limit 20 ng BSA).\n",
      "Wash gel in 100 mL ultrapure water for 10 minutes on shaker (detection limit 10 ng BSA).\n",
      "Add 20 mL 20% NaCl for at least 5 minutes (detection limit 5 ng BSA). The gel can be stored for several weeks in this salt solution.\n",
      "Drying the Gel\n",
      "The stained gel can be dried for storage or analysis by vacuum-drying or air-drying. The DryEase\u000214 Mini-Gel Drying System is recommended for air-drying. When using this system, restrict incubation time in Gel-Dry\u000214 Drying Solution to 5 minutes to avoid destaining.\n",
      "Disposal\n",
      "SimplyBlue\u000214 SafeStain can usually be diluted 1:20 with water and flushed down the drain, raising pH to 5-7 to comply with most regulations. Consult your safety officer for local disposal requirements.\n",

Sie ermöglichen die Messung mehrerer Ziele im selben Well durch Multiplexing. QuantiGene Plex Panels enthalten zwei Komponenten: ein zielgerichtetes Sondenset und magnetische Fangbeads. Die zielgerichteten Sonden werden verwendet, um die interessierende RNA zu erfassen, und die branched DNA-Technologie verstärkt dann die Fluoreszenzsignale, die mit einem Luminex xMAP-Instrument ausgelesen werden. Die Intensität des Fluoreszenzsignals ist direkt proportional zur Menge an Ziel-mRNA, die in der Probe vorhanden ist. Dies ermöglicht die (relative) Quantifizierung der Genexpression und mit diesem spezifischen Panel die menschliche Immunprofilierung. Eine detaillierte und schrittweise Datenanalyse wird durch die QuantiGene Plex Datenanalyse-App erleichtert.\n",

The protein mobility in SDS-PAGE gels is dependent on the:\\nLength of the protein in its fully denatured state,\\nSDS-PAGE buffer systems, and\\nSecondary structure of the protein.\\nThe same molecular weight standard may have slightly different mobility, resulting in different apparent molecular weight when run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems.\\nWhen using SDS-PAGE for molecular weight determination, slight deviations from the calculated molecular weight of a protein (calculated from the known amino acid sequence) can occur due to the retention of varying degrees of secondary structure in the protein, even in the presence of SDS. This phenomenon is observed in highly organized secondary structures (collagens, histones, or highly hydrophobic membrane proteins) and in peptides, where the effect of local secondary structure becomes magnified relative to the total size of the peptide.\\nSlight differences in protein mobilities also occur when the same proteins are run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems. Each SDS-PAGE buffer system has a different pH, which affects the charge of a protein and its binding capacity for SDS. The degree of change in protein mobility is usually small in natural proteins but more pronounced with 'atypical' or chemically modified proteins such as pre-stained standards.\\nSources 1\\nAdditional Data & References\\n1.

SimplyBlue™ SafeStain is a ready-to-use, proprietary Coomassie G-250 stain that is specially formulated for fast, sensitive detection and safe, non-hazardous disposal. Proteins stained using SimplyBlue™ SafeStain are compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.\\nBasic Protocol\\nRinse the mini-gel 3 times for 5 minutes with 100 mL deionized water to remove SDS and buffer salts, which interfere with binding of the dye to the protein. Discard each rinse.\\nStain the mini-gel with enough SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (~20 mL) to cover the mini-gel. Stain for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bands will begin to develop within minutes. After incubation, discard the stain. Do not re-use the stain.\\nWash the mini-gel with 100 mL water for 1-3 hours. The gel can be left in the water for several days without loss of sensitivity.\\nMicrowave Protocol\\nAfter electrophoresis, place the gel in 100 mL deionized water in a loosely covered container and microwave on High (950 to 1100 watts) for 1 minute until the solution almost boils.\\nShake the gel on an orbital shaker for 1 minute. Discard the water.\\nRepeat Steps 1-2 two more times.\\nAfter the last wash, add 20 mL SimplyBlue™ SafeStain and microwave on High for 45 seconds to 1 minute until the solution almost boils.\\nShake the gel on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes.

       "  \"Protein Structure Information\\nThe molecular weight of a protein can be determined based upon its relative mobility by constructing a standard curve with protein standards of known molecular weights. The protein mobility in SDS-PAGE gels is dependent on the:\\nLength of the protein in its fully denatured state,\\nSDS-PAGE buffer systems, and\\nSecondary structure of the protein.\\nThe same molecular weight standard may have slightly different mobility, resulting in different apparent molecular weight when run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems.\\nWhen using SDS-PAGE for molecular weight determination, slight deviations from the calculated molecular weight of a protein (calculated from the known amino acid sequence) can occur due to the retention of varying degrees of secondary structure in the protein, even in the presence of SDS. This phenomenon is observed in highly organized secondary structures (collagens, histones, or highly hydrophobic membrane proteins) and in peptides, where the effect of local secondary structure becomes magnified relative to the total size of the peptide.\\nSlight differences in protein mobilities also occur when the same proteins are run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems. Each SDS-PAGE buffer system has a different pH, which affects the charge of a protein and its binding capacity for SDS. The degree of change in protein mobility is usually small in natural proteins but more pronounced with 'atypical' or chemically modified proteins such as pre-stained standards.\\nSources 1\\nAdditional Data & References\\n1.

Sensitivity can be enhanced by adding NaCl during washing. Gels can be stored in water for several days with NaCl added to maintain sensitivity.\\nSYPRO\\x0212 Ruby Staining\\nRapid protocol involves fixing gels, staining with SYPRO Ruby stain with microwave heating and shaking, followed by washing steps. It offers excellent linearity and low background with detection limits of 0.25 to 1 ng protein.\\nSYPRO Ruby can also be used as a post-stain after other stains except colorimetric stains like Coomassie and silver stains.\\nSources 1\\n2\\nAdditional Data & References\\n1.

Remove the gel from the microwave and gently agitate it for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant the fixative.\\nWash the gel with 100 mL of 30% ethanol in a microwave at high power for 30 seconds. Remove the gel from the microwave and gently agitate it for 5 minutes at room temperature on a rotary shaker. Decant the ethanol.\\nAdd 100 mL of Sensitizing solution to the washed gel. Microwave at high power for 30 seconds. Remove the gel from the microwave and place it on a rotary shaker for 2 minutes at room temperature. Decant the Sensitizing solution.\\nSimplyBlue™ SafeStain\\nBasic Protocol:\\nRinse the mini-gel 3 times for 5 minutes with 100 mL deionized water to remove SDS and buffer salts, which interfere with binding of the dye to the protein. Discard each rinse.\\nStain the mini-gel with enough SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (~20 mL) to cover the mini-gel. Stain for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bands will begin to develop within minutes. After incubation, discard the stain. Do not re-use the stain.\\nWash the mini-gel with 100 mL water for 1-3 hours. The gel can be left in the water for several days without loss of sensitivity.\\nSYPRO® Ruby Staining\\nSYPRO® Ruby Rapid Protocol:\\nAfter electrophoresis, place the gel into a clean a microwavable container with 100 mL of Fix Solution and agitate on an orbital shaker for 15 minutes. Pour off the used fix solution and repeat once more with fresh Fix Solution.\\nPour off the used fix solution.\\nAdd 60 mL of SYPRO® Ruby gel stain to the tray containing the gel.\\nMicrowave 30 seconds, agitate 30 seconds to distribute heat evenly, then microwave another 30 seconds to reach 80–85°C, and agitate on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes.\\nReheat the gel by microwaving a third time for 30 seconds and then agitate on an orbital shaker for 23 minutes for a total stain time of 30 minutes.\\nTransfer the gel to a clean container and wash in 100 mL of Wash Solution for 30 minutes. The transfer step is necessary to avoid heating the destain solution, which may reduce stain sensitivity, and also helps minimize background staining irregularities and stain speckles on the gel.\\nRinse the gel in ultrapure water for 5 minutes. Repeat the rinse a minimum of one more time to prevent possible corrosive damage to your imager.\\nNote: If you are staining two gels, double the reagent volumes. Increase volumes 1.5-fold for 1.5mm thick gels.\\nHeat the gel in the microwave on full power in increments of 30–45 seconds, until the stain reaches 80–85°C.\\nDo not heat the fixative solution or other methanolic solutions in the microwave.\\nAlthough SYPRO® Ruby stain solution is not flammable, use caution when microwaving SYPRO® Ruby stain as the solution becomes very hot.\\nSources 1\\n2\\nAdditional Data & References\\n1.

Sie ermöglichen die Messung mehrerer Ziele im selben Well durch Multiplexing. QuantiGene Plex Panels enthalten zwei Komponenten: ein zielgerichtetes Sondenset und magnetische Fangbeads. Die zielgerichteten Sonden werden verwendet, um die interessierende RNA zu erfassen, und die branched DNA-Technologie verstärkt dann die Fluoreszenzsignale, die mit einem Luminex xMAP-Instrument ausgelesen werden. Die Intensität des Fluoreszenzsignals ist direkt proportional zur Menge an Ziel-mRNA, die in der Probe vorhanden ist. Dies ermöglicht die (relative) Quantifizierung der Genexpression und mit diesem spezifischen Panel die menschliche Immunprofilierung. Eine detaillierte und schrittweise Datenanalyse wird durch die QuantiGene Plex Datenanalyse-App erleichtert.\\nAnwendungen\\nForschungsanwendungen des QuantiGene Plex Assays umfassen das Screening von Wirkstoffkandidaten, die Verifizierung von Biomarkern, die Bestimmung der siRNA-Knockdown-Effizienz, die prospektive und/oder retrospektive Analyse klinischer Proben, die Validierung von Mikroarrays, die prädiktive Toxikologieforschung und die Erkennung von Translokations-/Fusionsgenen. Im Allgemeinen kann jede Multiplex-Genexpressionsanalyse mit QuantiGene Plex Assays durchgeführt werden, unabhängig von Spezies oder Probentyp.\\nZusätzliche Daten & Referenzen\\n1.

It is formulated for fast, sensitive protein detection and safe, non-hazardous disposal. Proteins stained with SimplyBlue\\x0214 SafeStain are compatible with mass spectrometry analysis.\\nBasic Protocol\\nRinse the mini-gel 3 times for 5 minutes each with 100 mL deionized water to remove SDS and buffer salts. Discard each rinse.\\nStain the mini-gel with approximately 20 mL SimplyBlue\\x0214 SafeStain to cover the gel. Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bands will develop within minutes. After staining, discard the stain; do not reuse.\\nWash the mini-gel with 100 mL water for 1-3 hours. The gel can remain in water for several days without loss of sensitivity.\\nNotes:\\nAn alcohol/acetic acid fixing step prior to staining is not required or recommended.\\nThe gel can be stained up to 3 hours; beyond that, sensitivity decreases. For overnight staining, add 2 mL 20% NaCl per 20 mL stain to maintain sensitivity.\\nFor highest sensitivity, after 1 hour wash, add 20 mL 20% NaCl to fresh water and continue washing for 2 hours to overnight (detection limit: 7 ng BSA).\\nFor clearest background for photography, perform a second 1-hour wash with 100 mL water.\\nAfter the second wash, sensitivity decreases if gel stays in water more than 1 day; add 20 mL 20% NaCl if storing for a few days.\\nMicrowave Protocol (Faster Method)\\nPlace gel in 100 mL deionized water in a loosely covered container and microwave on High (950-1100 watts) for 1 minute until solution almost boils.\\nShake gel on orbital shaker for 1 minute; discard water.\\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 two more times.\\nAdd 20 mL SimplyBlue\\x0214 SafeStain and microwave on High for 45 seconds to 1 minute until solution almost boils.\\nShake gel on orbital shaker for 5 minutes (detection limit 20 ng BSA).\\nWash gel in 100 mL ultrapure water for 10 minutes on shaker (detection limit 10 ng BSA).\\nAdd 20 mL 20% NaCl for at least 5 minutes (detection limit 5 ng BSA). The gel can be stored for several weeks in this salt solution.\\nDrying the Gel\\nThe stained gel can be dried for storage or analysis by vacuum-drying or air-drying. The DryEase\\x0214 Mini-Gel Drying System is recommended for air-drying. When using this system, restrict incubation time in Gel-Dry\\x0214 Drying Solution to 5 minutes to avoid destaining.\\nDisposal\\nSimplyBlue\\x0214 SafeStain can usually be diluted 1:20 with water and flushed down the drain, raising pH to 5-7 to comply with most regulations.

       "  'Using SimplyBlue™ SafeStain\\nIntroduction\\nThe NuPAGE® Large Protein Staining Kit includes the reagents to perform electrophoresis and staining with SimplyBlue™ SafeStain. SimplyBlue™ SafeStain is a ready-to-use, proprietary Coomassie G-250 stain that is specially formulated for fast, sensitive detection and safe, non-hazardous disposal. Proteins stained using SimplyBlue™ SafeStain are compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.\\nBasic Protocol\\nRinse the mini-gel 3 times for 5 minutes with 100 mL deionized water to remove SDS and buffer salts, which interfere with binding of the dye to the protein. Discard each rinse.\\nStain the mini-gel with enough SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (~20 mL) to cover the mini-gel. Stain for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bands will begin to develop within minutes. After incubation, discard the stain. Do not re-use the stain.\\nWash the mini-gel with 100 mL water for 1-3 hours. The gel can be left in the water for several days without loss of sensitivity.\\nMicrowave Protocol\\nAfter electrophoresis, place the gel in 100 mL deionized water in a loosely covered container and microwave on High (950 to 1100 watts) for 1 minute until the solution almost boils.\\nShake the gel on an orbital shaker for 1 minute. Discard the water.\\nRepeat Steps 1-2 two more times.\\nAfter the last wash, add 20 mL SimplyBlue™ SafeStain and microwave on High for 45 seconds to 1 minute until the solution almost boils.\\nShake the gel on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes. (Detection limit 20 ng BSA.)\\nWash the gel in 100 mL of ultrapure water for 10 minutes on a shaker. (Detection limit 10 ng BSA.)\\nAdd 20 mL of 20% NaCl for at least 5 minutes. (Detection limit 5 ng BSA.) The gel can be stored for several weeks in the salt solution.\\nDisposal Information\\nIn most cases, the SimplyBlue™ SafeStain can be diluted 1:20 with water and flushed down the drain. Diluting the stain raises the pH to between 5 and 7, which complies with most federal and state regulations. For disposal requirements in your area, consult your safety officer.\\nDrying the Gel\\nThe stained gel can be dried for storage or analysis by vacuum-drying or air-drying. We recommend using the DryEase™ Mini-Gel Drying System to air-dry the gel. When using the DryEase™ Mini-Gel Drying System, be sure to restrict the incubation time of your SimplyBlue™ SafeStain stained gel in the Gel-Dry™ Drying Solution to 5 minutes because longer exposure can result in destaining of bands.\\nSources 1\\nAdditional Data & References\\n1.

       "  \"Protein Structure Information\\nThe molecular weight of a protein can be determined based upon its relative mobility by constructing a standard curve with protein standards of known molecular weights. The protein mobility in SDS-PAGE gels is dependent on the:\\nLength of the protein in its fully denatured state,\\nSDS-PAGE buffer systems, and\\nSecondary structure of the protein.\\nThe same molecular weight standard may have slightly different mobility, resulting in different apparent molecular weight when run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems.\\nWhen using SDS-PAGE for molecular weight determination, slight deviations from the calculated molecular weight of a protein (calculated from the known amino acid sequence) can occur due to the retention of varying degrees of secondary structure in the protein, even in the presence of SDS. This phenomenon is observed in highly organized secondary structures (collagens, histones, or highly hydrophobic membrane proteins) and in peptides, where the effect of local secondary structure becomes magnified relative to the total size of the peptide.\\nSlight differences in protein mobilities also occur when the same proteins are run in different SDS-PAGE buffer systems. Each SDS-PAGE buffer system has a different pH, which affects the charge of a protein and its binding capacity for SDS. The degree of change in protein mobility is usually small in natural proteins but more pronounced with 'atypical' or chemically modified proteins such as pre-stained standards.\\nSources 1\\nAdditional Data & References\\n1.

Remove the gel from the microwave and gently agitate it for 5 minutes at room temperature. Decant the fixative.\\nWash the gel with 100 mL of 30% ethanol in a microwave at high power for 30 seconds. Remove the gel from the microwave and gently agitate it for 5 minutes at room temperature on a rotary shaker. Decant the ethanol.\\nAdd 100 mL of Sensitizing solution to the washed gel. Microwave at high power for 30 seconds. Remove the gel from the microwave and place it on a rotary shaker for 2 minutes at room temperature. Decant the Sensitizing solution.\\nSimplyBlue™ SafeStain\\nBasic Protocol:\\nRinse the mini-gel 3 times for 5 minutes with 100 mL deionized water to remove SDS and buffer salts, which interfere with binding of the dye to the protein. Discard each rinse.\\nStain the mini-gel with enough SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (~20 mL) to cover the mini-gel. Stain for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. Bands will begin to develop within minutes. After incubation, discard the stain. Do not re-use the stain.\\nWash the mini-gel with 100 mL water for 1-3 hours.

Pour off the used fix solution and repeat once more with fresh Fix Solution.\\nPour off the used fix solution.\\nAdd 60 mL of SYPRO® Ruby gel stain to the tray containing the gel.\\nMicrowave 30 seconds, agitate 30 seconds to distribute heat evenly, then microwave another 30 seconds to reach 80–85°C, and agitate on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes.\\nReheat the gel by microwaving a third time for 30 seconds and then agitate on an orbital shaker for 23 minutes for a total stain time of 30 minutes.\\nTransfer the gel to a clean container and wash in 100 mL of Wash Solution for 30 minutes. The transfer step is necessary to avoid heating the destain solution, which may reduce stain sensitivity, and also helps minimize background staining irregularities and stain speckles on the gel.\\nRinse the gel in ultrapure water for 5 minutes. Repeat the rinse a minimum of one more time to prevent possible corrosive damage to your imager.\\nNote: If you are staining two gels, double the reagent volumes. Increase volumes 1.5-fold for 1.5mm thick gels.\\nHeat the gel in the microwave on full power in increments of 30–45 seconds, until the stain reaches 80–85°C.\\nDo not heat the fixative solution or other methanolic solutions in the microwave.\\nAlthough SYPRO® Ruby stain solution is not flammable, use caution when microwaving SYPRO® Ruby stain as the solution becomes very hot.\\nSources 1\\n2\\nAdditional Data & References\\n1.
